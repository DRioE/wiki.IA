## Description

The **SIMPCCe** application has been developed as an innovative tool for evaluating the effects of climate change on reservoirs. Its objective is to facilitate the implementation of advanced methodologies without requiring code execution or the installation of multiple dependencies.

### Main Features:

1. **Hydrometeorological Data Analysis**: Integration of projected climate data and historical measurements to estimate the impact on reservoirs.
2. **Use of Artificial Intelligence**: Application of **machine learning models and neural networks** to identify patterns and perform hydrological forecasts.
3. **Generation of Climate Change Scenarios**: Modeling of different scenarios to assess the resilience of reservoirs under future conditions.
4. **Intuitive Interface**: Allows configuring and executing analyses without requiring advanced programming knowledge.

## Perspectives

🏞️ 📊 Water managers and hydrological planning authorities will be able to access detailed and real-time information on the evolution of reservoir storage.

🌍 🔍 📉 Integrating AI into climate forecasting analysis will enhance water management and help mitigate negative impacts.
